.SH NAME
mapitest \- OpenChange torture test utility

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
mapitest [-?|--help] [--usage] [-f|--database=STRING] [-p|--profile=STRING]
  [-p|--password=STRING] [--confidential] [--color]
  [-o|--outfile=STRING] [--mapi-calls=STRING] [--list-all] [--no-server]
  [--dump-data] [-d|--debuglevel=STRING]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
mapitest is a test harness / utility used for verifying correct operation
of various ExchangeRPC calls / MAPI functions provided by the OpenChange
MAPI libraries.

mapitest is not normally required by users, but you may be asked to provide
the output of mapitest for some kinds of bug investigations.

Note that mapitest performs a lot of transactions, including deleting folders
and messages. Unless you're very familiar with mapitest, we recommend only
using it with a test account.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.B --database
.TP
.B -f
Set the path to the profile database to use

.TP
.B --profile
.TP
.B -p
Set the profile to use. If no profile is specified, mapitest tries
to retrieve the default profile in the database. If no default profile
has been set, mapitest returns 
.B MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND .

.TP
.B --password
.TP
.B -P
Specify the password for the profile to use. This can be omitted if the
password is stored in the profile.

.TP
.B --confidential
Remove any sensitive data from the report.

.TP
.B --color
Use colors to indicate the results of each operation.

.TP
.B --outfile
.TP
.B -o
Redirect the output of the tests to a file. The filename must be specified
as the argument to this option.

.TP
.B --mapi-calls
Run a specific test. The name of the test must be specified as the argument
to this option. See the --list-all option to obtain the name of the test.
This can be specified more than once in order to run a subset of tests.

.TP
.B --list-all
Provide a list of all test suites and test names, along with a description
of the test. No tests will be run.

.TP
.B --no-server
Only run tests that do not require a server connection. This is the default
if a connection to the server cannot be established.

.TP
.B --dump-data
Dump the hex data. This is only required for debugging or educational purposes.

.TP
.B --debuglevel
.TP
.B -d
Set the debug level.

.SH EXAMPLES

.B Run all tests
.nf
mapitest
.fi

.B Only run two specific tests
.nf
mapitest --mapi-calls=NOSERVER-SROWSET --mapi-calls=OXCPRPT-GET-PROPS
.fi

.SH REMARKS
If you are using the default profile database path and have set a
default profile (using
.B mapiprofile --profile=profile_name -S
) you do not need to specify these parameters on the command line.
